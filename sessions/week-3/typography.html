            <h1>Prospect Park</h1>
                <p>Urban visionaries Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who most famously designed Central Park, also put their stamp on bucolic Prospect Park. Amenities like the Long Meadow and Nethermead offer plenty of space to pull up on a patch of grass and indulge in some people-watching, and the woodland expanse of the Ravine is a towering forest within bustling Brooklyn. Be sure to check out the Endale Arch and Concert Grove Pavilion. We've also have to give props to Robert Moses: The controversial city planner was behind some of the park’s kid-friendly offerings, including the zoo and Wollman Rink, which throws decade-themed skating parties all summer long.</p>

            <p>Like many small business owners, Kelly’s business was born out of a hobby — and necessity.
